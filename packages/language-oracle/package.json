Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.\n\n## Package conflicts\n\n1. [file-types](https://atom.io/packages/file-types)\n<br />Prior to this extension, in order to get your plsql files (extension plb, pls, pkb, pks, etc) recognised with the SQL grammar, you may have used this extension to map them to the `sql` extension.\n```\n\"file-types\":\n    pkb: \"source.sql\"\n    pks: \"source.sql\"\n    pls: \"source.sql\"\n    plb: \"source.sql\"\n```\nThis is no longer necessary, as this grammer picks up all relevant extensions and correctly maps them to `PL/SQL (Oracle)`. You should be able to safely remove that configuration.\n",
